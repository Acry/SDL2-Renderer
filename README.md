This is a series about the SDL2-Renderer  

  1 - sets up a Renderer and renders a png  
	1a, 1b, 1c using SDL_RenderCopyEx  
  2 - uses SDL_RenderDrawPoint to render a gradient.  
  3 - resizes the gradient to the window dimensions  
  4 - animates the gradient like a new shadertoy gradient.  
      Shows a bit how glsl works and why we want shaders.
